//! Loop unrolling, switched on by a `#[unroll]` annotation.
//!
//! Unrolling means making copies of a loop body so the loop runs fewer times
//! (or not at all), trading bigger code for less per-iteration overhead and more
//! chances to optimise. For example:
//!
//! ```text
//!   i = 0; while i < 4 { f(i); i += 1 }   becomes:   f(0); f(1); f(2); f(3);
//! ```
//!
//! `#[unroll]` requests full unrolling when the iteration count is known at
//! compile time. If MIR cannot infer the count, the native compiler receives
//! the full-unroll request and can infer it after inlining. `#[unroll(1)]` keeps the loop rolled, including in downstream
//! NVIDIA optimization. `#[unroll(N)]` for `N >= 2` requests `N` body copies per
//! trip and leaves a small remainder loop for leftover iterations. The frontend records the
//! request as a `mir.unroll_hint` operation inside that loop.
//!
//! The current analysis recognizes explicit counted `while` loops. Range-based
//! `for` loops use native metadata for `#[unroll]` and `#[unroll(1)]`; the
//! frontend does not yet recognize their induction variables.
//! Partial loops with early exits instead carry a native LLVM unroll count.
//!
//! Several `continue` paths are supported: the pass joins their back-edges
//! before unrolling. Full `#[unroll]` also preserves early `break` paths and
//! multiple exit targets. Partial `#[unroll(N)]` delegates to native LLVM
//! optimization when it has an extra exit. Partial unrolling currently requires a
//! positive step, a `<` or `<=` test, and a loop-invariant bound.
//!
//! To bound compile time and memory, one request may create at most 1,024 body
//! copies, 8,192 cloned blocks, and 65,536 cloned operations. Larger requests
//! warn and are not unrolled.
//!
//! If an annotated loop contains another loop, only the annotated loop is
//! unrolled. The inner loop is copied intact into each body copy and remains a
//! loop. Give the inner loop its own annotation if it should be unrolled too.
//!
//! This pass is the reference example for writing an optimisation pass in oxide.
//! It builds on two reusable analyses, [`LoopInfo`](crate::analyses::loop_info)
//! (finds the loops) and [`induction`] (finds the counters and how many times
//! each loop runs), and on pliron's IR cloning (`pliron::irbuild::cloning`) to
//! duplicate the body.

/// shapes are then the same constant on every iteration, so we replace each with
/// a literal (note `x & (2^k - 1)` and `x % 2^k` are the same operation):
///
/// ```text
///   iv & MASK   (MASK = 2^k - 1)      keep the low k bits
///   iv % M      (M a power of two)    same thing: x % 2^k == x & (2^k - 1)
/// ```
///
/// Both read only the low k bits, and a multiple of N has *fixed* low k bits
/// exactly when the window `2^k` divides the unroll step `N*step`. Example,
/// N = 4, `(iv + j) & 3` (the gemm pipeline-stage index):
///
/// ```text
///   iv = 0, 4, 8, 12, ...   all end in ...00, so:

///   => each copy's stage index is a compile-time constant.
/// ```
///
/// Fires only when ALL of these hold (otherwise the value genuinely changes each
/// iteration, so there is nothing to fold and we skip):
///
/// - the op is `(iv +/- consts) & MASK` or `(iv +/- consts) % M`;
/// - the window (`MASK + 1`, or `M`) is a power of two -- so it reads only low
///   bits and is therefore immune to the type's wraparound;
/// - that window divides the unroll step `N*step` -- so the low bits never move;
/// - for `%`, the operand type is unsigned (signed `%` follows the dividend's
///   sign, which breaks the equality with the masked low bits);
/// - `M > 0` -- never fold `% 0` (rem-by-zero is a Rust panic).
///
/// Deliberately NOT handled: non-power-of-two `% M` (e.g. `% 3`). The congruence

/// of `M`, shifting the result. Documented gap, left for later.
///
