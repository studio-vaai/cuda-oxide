//! Grid-scoped NVVM operations.
//!
//! The grid is the union of every block (and cluster) in a single kernel
//! launch. There is no PTX instruction that synchronises the grid directly:
//! `bar.sync 0` is block-scoped and `barrier.cluster.{arrive,wait}` is
//! cluster-scoped. Grid-wide barriers are implemented in software (see the
//! lowering for [`GridSyncOp`]) and require the kernel to be launched
//! cooperatively (`cuLaunchKernelEx` + `CU_LAUNCH_ATTRIBUTE_COOPERATIVE`).
