#![allow(non_snake_case)]
//! CUDA thread intrinsics and thread-safe index types.
//!
//! This module provides:
//! - `ThreadIndex<'kernel, IndexSpace>`: a typed witness derived from
//!   hardware built-in variables, with a `'kernel` lifetime that pins it
//!   to the kernel body
//! - Thread intrinsics: `threadIdx_x`, `blockIdx_x`, etc.
//! - Index helpers: `index_1d`, `index_2d::<S>`, `index_2d_runtime(&slice)`
//!   that return typed `ThreadIndex` witnesses
//! - `IndexFormula`: a marker trait for index spaces that can be derived
//!   from the kernel launch context alone (used by `DisjointSlice::get_mut_indexed`)
//!
//! # Safety Model
//!
//! The safety of parallel writes to `DisjointSlice` relies on each thread
//! accessing a unique memory location. This is guaranteed as follows:
//!
//! 1. **ThreadIndex** can only be constructed by trusted functions:
//!    `index_1d()`, `index_2d::<S>()`, and `index_2d_runtime(&slice)`.
//! 2. These functions derive the index from hardware built-in variables
//!    (`threadIdx`, `blockIdx`, `blockDim`) -- read-only special registers
//!    assigned by the runtime at kernel launch. The formula
//!    `outer * stride + inner` combines these into a scalar index per thread.
//! 3. `index_1d`: the X-only formula is unique only for a 1D launch. A typed
//!    1D contract proves that shape; the legacy path checks all Y/Z grid and
//!    block dimensions at runtime and makes the witness invalid on mismatch.
//! 4. `index_2d::<S>()`: unique per thread for const-stride 2D grids.
//!    The stride lives in the witness type, and `DisjointSlice` only
//!    accepts indices from the matching index space -- mismatched
//!    strides are a compile error.
//! 5. `index_2d_runtime(&slice)`: the witness stores the thread's raw
//!    `(row, col)` coordinates, not a flat index. The addressed
//!    `DisjointSlice` resolves them against its own host-bound row width at
//!    the access site, so distinct threads always resolve distinct
//!    elements no matter which slice minted the witness.
//! 6. The witness is `!Send + !Sync + !Copy + !Clone` and `'kernel`-scoped,
//!    so threads can't launder it through shared memory and it can't
//!    outlive the kernel body.

/// - [`index_2d_runtime()`] for runtime-row-width 2D grids; safe, the width
///   is read from the slice the index will address, bound once by the host
///
/// # Where you can call them
///
/// The `'kernel` launch context only exists inside `#[kernel]` and `#[device]`
/// bodies, which has two practical consequences:
///
/// - **Plain `fn` device helpers (no annotation)** can't acquire a
///   `ThreadIndex`. The public `thread::index_*` items are `unreachable!`
///   stubs — they compile and import fine, but calling one outside an
///   annotated body panics on first call. The macros rewrite real
///   call sites to `thread::__internal::*`, which is what actually runs
///   on the device. If a helper needs an index, take it as a parameter.
/// - **`#[device]` fns** *can* call `thread::index_*`, but they can't
///   return the resulting `ThreadIndex` — `'kernel` is borrowed from the
///   helper's local scope and dies at function exit. Use the witness
///   inside the helper. (`#[device]` is mainly for FFI exports via
///   LTOIR, where this restriction doesn't bite.)
///
/// # Reserved names inside `#[kernel]` and `#[device]`
///
/// The macros rewrite a small set of names inside annotated bodies so
/// the user never has to pass the launch context through by hand:
///
/// - free functions: `index_1d`, `index_2d`, `index_2d_runtime`, `warp_index`
/// - methods (zero-arg call sites): `get_mut_indexed`
///
/// Free-function calls are matched on path tail, so all of these resolve
/// to the same intrinsic:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// thread::index_1d()
/// cuda_device::thread::index_1d()
/// use cuda_device::thread::index_1d;  index_1d()
/// use cuda_device::thread::index_1d as get_idx;  get_idx() // not rewritten — alias
/// ```
///
/// Method calls are matched on the method name only — `slice.get_mut_indexed()`
/// has the launch context spliced in as the (currently invisible)
/// `&LaunchContext` argument the method actually takes.
///
/// The trade-off: if you define a local `fn index_1d` (or any of the
/// other reserved names) and call it from inside `#[kernel]` or
/// `#[device]`, the macro will silently rewrite that call too. Pick a
/// different name (e.g. `compute_index_1d`, `pop_indexed`) for any
/// helper you want to keep.
///
/// The proof-carrying [`index_1d_u32`] and [`coord_2d_u32`] functions are not
/// on this list. They take the launch context named explicitly by
/// `#[kernel(launch_context = ...)]`, so ordinary Rust aliases and same-named
/// local functions behave normally.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use cuda_device::{DisjointSlice, kernel, thread};
///
/// #[kernel]
/// fn vecadd(a: &[f32], b: &[f32], mut c: DisjointSlice<f32>) {

///
/// `.maxntid` and `.reqntid` on one entry is a ptxas error, so a kernel

/// Loops with several `continue` paths are supported. Full `#[unroll]` also
/// preserves `break` paths and multiple exit targets. Partial `#[unroll(N)]`

///
/// - `FACTOR = 0` requests full unrolling of this loop and requires a
